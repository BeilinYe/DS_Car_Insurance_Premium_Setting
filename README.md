# DS_Car_Insurance_Premium_Setting

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze factors that influence the total claim amount in car insurance accidents by leveraging two datasets from different insurance companies. Using predictive modeling techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the analysis explores the relationship between key variables, including vehicle age, customer characteristics, and policy details, to predict claim amounts. The insights gained will help insurance companies optimize pricing strategies, balancing risk and profitability while maintaining fairness for policyholders.

## Problem Statement
Insurance companies face challenges in ensuring profitability while offering competitive and fair premiums to policyholders. One critical aspect is accurately predicting car insurance claim amounts, which depend on various factors like the age of the vehicle, customer demographics, and policy features. By understanding these factors, companies can better set premiums and categorize high-risk policies, maintaining a balance between profitability and customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on two datasets obtained from different insurance companies. These datasets contain the following key variables:

- **Dataset 1**:  
  - Customer lifetime value  
  - Income  
  - Monthly premium auto  
  - Months since last claim  
  - Months since policy inception  
  - Number of open complaints  
  - Number of policies

- **Dataset 2**:  
  - Months as customer  
  - Policy state  
  - Policy deductible  
  - Policy annual premium  
  - Umbrella limit  
  - Insured sex  
  - Insured education level  
  - Incident state  
  - Days from bind date  
  - Auto year

The data was preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency before analysis.

## Methodology
To predict the total claim amount and analyze the relationships between variables, we applied the following predictive models:

1. **Linear Regression**  
   - Used to establish linear relationships between the independent variables and the claim amount.
   
2. **Decision Tree**  
   - Implemented to capture non-linear patterns and identify important variables affecting the claim amount.
   
3. **Naive Bayes**  
   - Used as a probabilistic model to classify the likelihood of claim amounts based on categorical and continuous data.
   
These models were evaluated and compared based on their accuracy and performance.

## Results
The analysis revealed that factors such as the **age of the vehicle (auto year)**, **monthly premium**, and **policy deductible** significantly impact the total claim amount. The models were compared, and the **Decision Tree** model performed the best in predicting claim amounts, offering valuable insights into how insurance companies can refine their pricing strategies.
